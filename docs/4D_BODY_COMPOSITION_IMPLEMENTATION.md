# 4D Body Composition Learning - Implementation Complete

## Overview

Successfully implemented **4D continuous body composition learning** that learns from actual weight, IBW ratio, ABW ratio, and BMI independently. This replaces the previous 3-category system and allows learning across the full spectrum from super skinny (BMI 13.8) to morbidly obese (BMI 58.8).

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Four Independent Learning Dimensions

#### Dimension 1: Actual Weight
- **Bucketing:** 10kg ranges (40-50, 50-60, 60-70, ..., 180-190kg)
- **Learning:** System learns "patients at 120kg need different dosing than 80kg"
- **Range:** 0.6-1.4x (wider than other factors to handle extremes)

#### Dimension 2: IBW Ratio (weight/IBW)
- **Bucketing:** 0.1 increments (0.6x, 0.7x, 0.8x, ..., 2.4x)
- **Learning:** System learns "patients at 180% of IBW need different dosing"
- **Calculation:** IBW (Ideal Body Weight) = height_cm - 100 (males) or height_cm - 105 (females)

#### Dimension 3: ABW Ratio (ABW/IBW)
- **Bucketing:** 0.1 increments (1.1x, 1.2x, 1.3x, ...)
- **Learning:** System learns "patients with ABW significantly different from IBW need adjustment"
- **Applies to:** Only overweight patients (weight > IBW * 1.2)
- **Calculation:** ABW = IBW + 0.4 × (actual weight - IBW)

#### Dimension 4: BMI
- **Bucketing:** 7 categories covering full spectrum
  - Very Underweight: BMI <18 (bucket=16)
  - Underweight: BMI 18-20 (bucket=19)
  - Normal: BMI 20-25 (bucket=22)
  - Overweight: BMI 25-30 (bucket=27)
  - Obese: BMI 30-35 (bucket=32)
  - Very Obese: BMI 35-40 (bucket=37)
  - Morbidly Obese: BMI ≥40 (bucket=42)
- **Learning:** System learns category-specific patterns

## Files Modified

### 1. `database.py` (lines 972-1066)
**New Functions:**
- `get_body_composition_factor(user_id, metric_type, metric_value, default_factor)`
- `update_body_composition_factor(user_id, metric_type, metric_value, default_factor, adjustment)`

**New Table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE learning_body_composition (
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    metric_type TEXT NOT NULL,  -- 'weight' | 'ibw_ratio' | 'abw_ratio' | 'bmi'
    metric_value REAL NOT NULL,  -- bucketed value
    composition_factor REAL DEFAULT 1.0,
    num_observations INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, metric_type, metric_value),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
)
```

### 2. `learning_engine.py` (lines 297-426)
**Added 4D Learning Logic:**
- Calculates all 4 body composition metrics from patient data
- Updates all 4 dimensions independently when learning occurs
- Each dimension has its own adjustment magnitude
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

**Example learning output:**
```
**Weight factor (62kg):** -> 0.971
**IBW ratio (1.1x):** -> 0.971
**BMI factor (23.1 - Normal):** -> 0.971
```

### 3. `calculation_engine.py` (lines 188-232)
**Integrated 4D Learning into Dose Calculation:**
- Retrieves learned factors for all 4 dimensions
- Applies each factor as a multiplier to the dose
- Only applies ABW ratio for overweight patients (weight > IBW * 1.2)
- Uses same bucketing logic as learning for consistency

### 4. `migrations.py` (lines 214-300)
**Added Migration v3:**
- Drops old `learning_weight_factors` table (3-category system)
- Creates new `learning_body_composition` table (4D continuous system)
- Adds index for faster lookups
- Logs migration progress

**Migration Command:**
```python
if current_version < 3:
    migrate_to_v3()
    set_db_version(3)
```

### 5. `COMPLETE_LEARNING_SYSTEM_SUMMARY.md`
**Updated Documentation:**
- Changed "Weight/Body Composition Learning (3D)" to "4D"
- Added explanation of all 4 dimensions
- Updated examples to show 4D learning
- Added "Why 4D?" section explaining full spectrum coverage

## Testing

### Test File: `test_4d_body_composition.py`

**Test 1: Case A Learning**
- 62kg female patient (BMI 23.1, IBW 59kg, ratio 1.05x)
- Recommended 7mg, gave 5.2mg, perfect outcome
- Verifies all 4 dimensions learn independently
- Result: ✓ All factors decreased (0.986 -> 0.978)

**Test 2: Full Spectrum Coverage**
- Tests 6 body types:
  - Very underweight (40kg, BMI 13.8)
  - Normal weight (55kg, BMI 20.2)
  - Overweight (85kg, BMI 27.8)
  - Obese (110kg, BMI 35.9)
  - Very obese (140kg, BMI 45.7)
  - Morbidly obese (180kg, BMI 58.8)
- Verifies correct bucketing for all 4 dimensions
- Result: ✓ Full spectrum covered

**All tests passed successfully!**

## Key Benefits

### 1. Continuous Learning Across Full Spectrum
**Before:** 3 categories (underweight, obese, very obese)
**After:** Continuous learning from BMI 13.8 to BMI 58.8

### 2. Nuanced Pattern Detection
The system can now learn subtle patterns like:
- "Patients at 120kg actual weight need 5% less than calculated"
- "Patients at 180% of IBW need 8% more than calculated"
- "Obese patients with ABW ratio 1.3x need different dosing than 1.5x"
- "Morbidly obese (BMI 42) patients need different adjustments than obese (BMI 32)"

### 3. Independent Dimensions
Each metric learns independently, allowing the system to capture:
- Absolute weight effects
- Body composition effects (weight relative to ideal)
- Obesity-adjusted effects (ABW accuracy)
- BMI category effects

### 4. Clinically Relevant
- Handles super skinny patients (anorexia, cachexia)
- Handles normal weight patients
- Handles overweight patients
- Handles obese patients (class I, II, III)
- Each category learns independently

## Example Usage

### Scenario: 72-year-old female, 164cm, 62kg, cholecystectomy

**Body Composition Calculation:**
```python
weight = 62kg
height = 164cm
sex = 'Kvinna'

BMI = 62 / (1.64²) = 23.1 (Normal)
IBW = 164 - 105 = 59kg
IBW_ratio = 62 / 59 = 1.05x
weight_bucket = 60kg (60-70 range)
ibw_ratio_bucket = 1.1x (1.05 rounds to 1.1)
bmi_bucket = 22 (20-25 range)
```

**Dose Calculation:**
```python
mme = 15.0  # Base cholecystectomy MME
mme *= age_factor(72)  # 0.82x
mme *= sex_factor('Kvinna')  # 1.00x (learned)
mme *= body_comp_factor('weight', 60)  # 0.98x (learned)
mme *= body_comp_factor('ibw_ratio', 1.1)  # 0.98x (learned)
# No ABW ratio (not overweight)
mme *= body_comp_factor('bmi', 22)  # 0.98x (learned)
# ... other factors
```

**Learning:**
If you give 5.2mg and outcome is perfect while recommendation was 7mg:
```python
# All 4 dimensions learn:
update_body_composition_factor(user_id, 'weight', 60, adjustment=-0.007)
update_body_composition_factor(user_id, 'ibw_ratio', 1.1, adjustment=-0.007)
update_body_composition_factor(user_id, 'bmi', 22, adjustment=-0.007)
# ABW not applicable (patient not overweight)
```

## Safety Limits

**Per-case adjustment:** ±3% per dimension
**Overall range:** 0.6-1.4x (wider than other patient factors)
**Outlier damping:** 50% reduction if VAS >8 or UVA >15mg
**Num observations tracked:** System gains confidence over time

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Sex-Specific Body Composition
Learn separate body composition factors for males vs females:
- Obese females may need different ABW adjustments than obese males
- Sex-specific IBW ratios

### 2. Age-Specific Body Composition
Learn age-specific patterns:
- Elderly patients with low BMI may have sarcopenia
- Young obese patients may have different metabolic rates

### 3. Procedure-Specific Body Composition
Learn if certain procedures have different body composition effects:
- Laparoscopic surgery in obese patients
- Orthopedic surgery in underweight patients

## Conclusion

The 4D body composition learning system successfully covers "the whole gamut of weights from superskinny to morbidly obese" as requested. It learns from actual clinical outcomes across 4 independent metrics, providing nuanced and clinically relevant dosing recommendations for all body types.
