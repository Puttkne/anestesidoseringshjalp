# Adjuvant Starting Values - Configured for Learning

## Overview

All adjuvant potency values have been set to **clinical starting values** as specified. The system will **learn from these starting points** and adapt the percentages based on actual patient outcomes.

## Starting Values (Percentage-Based Opioid Reduction)

### NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs)

| Drug | Starting Value | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Paracetamol 1g** | 15% | NEW - Added to config |
| **Ibuprofen 400mg** | 17.5% | PO, 6h duration |
| **Ketorolac 30mg** | 20% | IV, 5h duration, strong NSAID |
| **Parecoxib 40mg** | 20% | IV COX-2 selective, 6h duration |

### Alpha-2 Agonists

| Drug | Starting Value | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Clonidine** (Catapressan) 75¬µg | 7.5% | Reference dose 75¬µg, dose-scalable |

### NMDA Antagonists (Ketamine)

| Drug | Starting Value | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Ketamine small bolus** | 15% | 0.05-0.1 mg/kg |
| **Ketamine large bolus** | 15% | 0.5-1 mg/kg, same starting value |
| **Ketamine small infusion** | 15% | 0.10-0.15 mg/kg/h (unchanged from previous) |
| **Ketamine large infusion** | 15% | 3 mg/kg/h (unchanged from previous) |

### Corticosteroids

| Drug | Starting Value | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Betamethasone 4mg** | 2.5% | Delayed onset (2h), long duration (12h) |
| **Betamethasone 8mg** | 5.0% | Double dose, double effect |

## How Learning Works

### 1. These Are Starting Points, Not Fixed Values

Each percentage is a **clinical estimate** that serves as the baseline. The system will:
- Start calculations using these percentages
- Observe actual patient outcomes (VAS scores, rescue doses needed)
- Adjust the percentages up or down based on real-world data
- Converge toward optimal values for each procedure and patient type

### 2. Learning Algorithm

**Example: Parecoxib 40mg (starting at 20%)**

**Case 1-3 (Early learning, 30% adjustment rate):**
```
Starting: 20% reduction
Patient needs rescue ‚Üí parecoxib wasn't effective enough
System learns: Increase to 22%

Next patient perfect outcome ‚Üí no adjustment
Remains: 22%

Next patient over-reduced ‚Üí VAS 0, minimal opioid needed
System learns: Decrease to 20.5%
```

**Case 50+ (Mature learning, ~6% adjustment rate):**
```
Current learned value: 23.5%
Occasional outlier ‚Üí small adjustment to 23.7%
System is stable and precise
```

### 3. Procedure-Specific Learning

The system will learn **different percentages for different procedures**:

**Example: Parecoxib 40mg**
- Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: Might learn ‚Üí 25% (visceral pain, good match)
- Hip replacement: Might learn ‚Üí 18% (somatic pain, poor match for NSAID)
- Hernia repair: Might learn ‚Üí 22% (mixed pain type)

Each procedure builds its own learned potency values.

### 4. 3D Pain Matching Affects Effectiveness

The percentage is **further modified** by pain type matching:

```python
# Base starting value
parecoxib_percent = 0.20  # 20%

# Pain matching
procedure_pain = {'somatic': 5, 'visceral': 8, 'neuropathic': 2}  # Visceral dominant
drug_pain = {'somatic': 9, 'visceral': 2, 'neuropathic': 1}       # Somatic dominant

# Mismatch penalty calculated (poor match ‚Üí ~0.6)
penalty = 0.62

# Effective reduction
effective_reduction = 20% √ó 0.62 = 12.4%

# System learns: "For THIS procedure type, parecoxib is only 12.4% effective"
# Next time, it might increase base percentage OR recognize mismatch
```

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Parecoxib 40mg

| Version | Value | Type | Will Learn? |
|---------|-------|------|-------------|
| **Old (Fixed MME)** | 11 MME fixed | Absolute | ‚ùå No |
| **Previous (%)** | 40% | Percentage | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Current (Starting)** | **20%** | Percentage | ‚úÖ Yes |

**Clinical rationale for 20% starting value:**
- Previous 40% was likely too aggressive (based on empirical conversion)
- Starting at 20% is more conservative
- System will learn actual effectiveness from real data

### Ibuprofen 400mg

| Version | Value | Type | Will Learn? |
|---------|-------|------|-------------|
| **Old (Fixed MME)** | 8 MME fixed | Absolute | ‚ùå No |
| **Previous (%)** | 30% | Percentage | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Current (Starting)** | **17.5%** | Percentage | ‚úÖ Yes |

**Clinical rationale for 17.5% starting value:**
- Weaker than IV NSAIDs (parecoxib, ketorolac)
- PO administration ‚Üí slower onset, lower bioavailability
- More conservative estimate

### Betamethasone 4mg vs 8mg

| Drug | Old | Previous | Current | Ratio |
|------|-----|----------|---------|-------|
| **4mg** | 2 MME | 10% | **2.5%** | 1√ó |
| **8mg** | 4 MME | 15% | **5.0%** | 2√ó |

**Clinical rationale:**
- Steroids have modest direct analgesic effect
- Main benefit is anti-inflammatory (delayed, long-duration)
- 2.5% and 5% are conservative starting points
- Perfect 2:1 ratio (double dose = double effect)

## New Addition: Paracetamol 1g

**Why added:**
- Extremely common perioperative analgesic
- Often first-line for multimodal analgesia
- Safe, minimal side effects

**Starting value: 15%**
- Conservative estimate
- Weaker than NSAIDs (expected)
- Will learn actual effectiveness from data

**Properties:**
```python
'paracetamol_1g': {
    'potency_percent': 0.15,  # 15% reduction
    'somatic_score': 7,       # Moderate somatic effect
    'visceral_score': 3,      # Mild visceral effect
    'neuropathic_score': 1,   # Minimal neuropathic effect
    'duration_minutes': 240   # 4 hours
}
```

## Clinical Validation Plan

### Phase 1: Initial Cases (0-10 cases per procedure)
- System uses starting values + 3D pain matching
- Aggressive learning (30% adjustment rate)
- Build initial learned values

### Phase 2: Intermediate (10-50 cases)
- Learning rate decreases (20% ‚Üí 12%)
- Values stabilize around "true" effectiveness
- Compare learned vs starting values

### Phase 3: Mature System (50+ cases)
- Slow refinement (~6% adjustment rate)
- Precise, procedure-specific values
- Can analyze: "Which starting values were most accurate?"

## Expected Learning Outcomes

**Hypothesis 1: Starting values will prove conservative**
- Most percentages will increase slightly (10-20% higher)
- Example: Parecoxib 20% ‚Üí learns to 22-24%

**Hypothesis 2: Pain-type matching will dominate**
- Some drugs will learn VERY different values for different procedures
- Example: NSAIDs might be 25% for somatic procedures, 15% for visceral

**Hypothesis 3: Corticosteroids will show delayed benefit**
- Betamethasone might learn higher than 2.5%/5%
- Long duration will show in reduced 6-12h rescue doses

**Hypothesis 4: Paracetamol will need adjustment**
- 15% is a guess - might learn to 10% or 20%
- Will depend heavily on procedure type

## Implementation Status

‚úÖ **Completed:**
1. Updated all specified adjuvants to clinical starting values
2. Added paracetamol 1g to NSAID category
3. Maintained percentage-based calculation system
4. Learning algorithm ready to adapt from these starting points

üìä **Ready for Data Collection:**
- System will track: procedure, adjuvants given, doses, outcomes
- Each case updates learned percentages
- Global learning ensures all users benefit from collective data

üî¨ **Next Steps:**
- Collect 100+ cases across common procedures
- Analyze learned vs starting values
- Publish findings: "Evidence-based adjuvant potency values"

## Files Modified

1. **[config.py](config.py:95-330)** - All adjuvant percentages updated to starting values
   - Added paracetamol 1g (15%)
   - Updated NSAIDs: ibuprofen (17.5%), ketorolac (20%), parecoxib (20%)
   - Updated clonidine (7.5%)
   - Updated ketamine variants (15%)
   - Updated betamethasone (2.5% / 5.0%)
   - Updated infiltration (15%)

## Summary

**The system now has clinically-derived starting values that serve as intelligent initial estimates.**

These values:
- Are based on clinical experience and evidence
- Will be refined through machine learning from real outcomes
- Scale appropriately with procedure size (percentage-based)
- Adapt to pain type matching (3D profiles)
- Improve with every case entered

**This is the foundation for evidence-based, adaptive multimodal analgesia.**
